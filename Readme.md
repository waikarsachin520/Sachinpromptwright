     ```
   - Add your API keys:
     ```
     OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
     ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key_here
     DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=your_deepseek_api_key_here
     GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
     GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key_here
     ```
   - For remote browser execution, configure cloud provider API keys:
     ```
     BROWSERBASE_API_KEY=your_browserbase_api_key_here
     STEELDEV_API_KEY=your_steeldev_api_key_here
     BROWSERLESS_API_KEY=your_browserless_api_key_here
     LIGHTPANDA_API_KEY=your_lightpanda_api_key_here
     ```
   - Make sure Chrome is installed on your system for local browser execution

## Running the Application

Launch the Streamlit app with:
```bash
streamlit run src/app.py
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:8501` by default.

## Using Promptwright

1. Configure your preferences in the sidebar:
   - Select AI model provider and model
   - Choose browser execution mode (local/remote)
   - Select target framework for code generation
2. Enter your automation task in natural language
3. Click "Go 🚀" to start the process
4. Watch as Promptwright:
   - Executes the task in a browser
   - Records the actions
   - Generates clean, reusable code in your chosen framework
   - Provides an interactive elements table
5. Download the generated code and elements data for future use

## Example Tasks

- Visit a website and fill out registration forms
- Perform search operations on websites
- Navigate through web applications
- Interact with UI elements (buttons, forms, etc.)
- Verify content and validate data
- Visit https://thinking-tester-contact-list.herokuapp.com/, login with 'testronai.com@gmail.com' as username and 'password' as password and submit. Then click 'Add a New Contact', fill in the contact form with random Indian-style data, and verify the contact details are correctly displayed in the table. Then logout from the application.
- Go to https://thinking-tester-contact-list.herokuapp.com/ and enter using any random funny username and password and do not submit the form.
- Go to google.com and search for 'testronai', and open the first link which has the word testronai in it.
- Go to testronai.com and click on watch demo button

## System Requirements

- Python 3.11+
- Chrome browser (for local execution)
- Internet connection
- API key(s) for chosen AI model provider
- API key for cloud browser provider (if using remote execution)

## Important Notes

1. Ensure Chrome is installed for local browser execution
2. Keep your API keys secure and never commit them to version control
3. Generated scripts require appropriate framework setup to run independently:
   - Node.js/Playwright for TypeScript scripts
   - Python/Playwright for Python scripts
   - Node.js/Cypress for Cypress scripts
   - Java/Selenium for Java scripts
